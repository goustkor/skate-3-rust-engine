# Skate 3 Rust Engine

A Rust and Bevy skating project built from Skate 3 reverse-engineering research.
Includes skating, tricks, grinds, offboard movement, difficulty settings and
`.skate` map support. Gameplay parity is still a work in progress.

## History

Before this rewrite existed, **dumbad** spent more than two years reverse
engineering Skate 3 and building the tools needed to understand and work with
it. That meant countless hours digging through undocumented file formats,
animation data, and game interaction systems, then testing those discoveries
in the original game. Much of that work is collected in
[DumbadsSkate3ModdingTools](https://github.com/Ethanw05/DumbadsSkate3ModdingTools),
including tools for custom maps, meshes, collision, challenges, and DLC.

That research laid the groundwork for this project. Chasm later worked on a
recompilation and a custom renderer based on dumbad's earlier renderer work,
before moving into the Rust/Bevy rewrite. The rewrite's development time tells
only part of the story: the knowledge and tools it relies on took years of
work to establish.

## AI usage

AI coding tools were used to develop this rewrite, but none of it would have
been possible without dumbad's extraordinary effort to reverse engineer the
original game. The AI had years of hard-earned research and working tools to
build on. Describing the project as simply “AI rewriting Skate 3” leaves out
the work that made it possible in the first place.

AI helped turn that knowledge into a new implementation; it does not replace
credit for discovering how the game works. This is still a work in progress,
and using original assets or showing working tricks does not mean every
system behaves exactly like the original.

## Play

[Download Experimental](https://github.com/SK8-ENGINE/skate-3-rust-engine/releases/tag/experimental).
Successful `main` builds replace this prerelease. Choose **Latest** in Updates
for experimental updates; **Stable** is the default.

Extract the Windows release ZIP and run `skate3rust.exe`. Select your Skate 3
Xbox 360 ISO, or select `default.xex` in an extracted game folder. Keep its
`data` folder alongside it. Setup prepares the skater, animations and all disc maps, then
starts University. The original scoring and session-marker HUD assets are also
exported automatically during setup. No Blender, Python or Rust installation is needed.
ISO extraction needs internet access. The first conversion can take a while.

Use an XInput controller to play. Escape opens graphics, difficulty and map
settings. Maps can be switched without restarting the game.

**Skate 3 assets are not included.** Your converted files stay in
the `data` folder beside your executable. Each freshly unpacked copy runs its
own setup; it does not adopt another installation. In-place updates refresh
only changed asset groups.

## Build

Requires Windows, Rust with the MSVC toolchain, and LLVM installed in its default
location. Run `BUILD.bat` to build, then `PLAY.bat` to launch the test world.
`PLAY.bat` opens your saved map (University by default); use the in-game menu to switch maps, or drag a `.skate` file onto `PLAY.bat`. An XInput controller is required for gameplay;
Escape opens difficulty and graphics settings.

Development builds use a prepared asset set in `assets/private/` or the
installed asset directory. `scripts/Build-Release.ps1` builds the portable Windows
package and requires Python 3.13. GitHub Actions builds `main` automatically;
numbered releases are published separately.

Custom animations and climbing support remain available, but no custom clips
are shipped. The included format-demo map is original procedural content.

## Local multiplayer (development)

Run the authoritative session server and several game clients from source,
without building a `dist/` package:

```powershell
scripts\multiplayer-dev.bat                 # server + 2 clients
scripts\multiplayer-dev.bat --instances 3   # server + 3 clients
scripts\multiplayer-dev.bat --test-world    # lightweight test scene
scripts\multiplayer-dev.bat --dry-run       # print the commands only
```

The launcher starts the Go session server with `go run` and each client with
`cargo run`. The first invocation compiles the debug profile; later ones reuse
it. It waits for each client's first physics tick before starting the next, so
map loading and shader compilation do not overlap.

Each process opens in its **own titled console** that shows that process's live
logs — `Server` for `skated`, and `Player 1`, `Player 2`, … for the clients
(whose published player name is also `Player N`). The launcher terminal itself
prints only status. The full output is also written to `logs/multiplayer-dev-*`.
Every process is placed in a Windows kill-on-close job, so **closing the
launcher terminal (or Ctrl+C) stops the server and all clients automatically**.
Close the game windows to stop normally, or pass `--no-server` to attach to a
server you started yourself.

`scripts\dev-multiplayer.ps1` exposes the extra options (`-Instances`, `-Map`,
`-Assets`, `-Server`, `-UseBuiltServer`). A client connects with
`cargo run -p skate-game --bin skate3rust -- --net-server 127.0.0.1:31030
--multi-instance --gpu-backend vulkan`.

their licenses are in [`vendor/`](vendor/). This is an unofficial project,

## Advanced diagnostics

Windows builds support opt-in [performance timeline capture](docs/performance-tracing.md)
through the `--trace` CLI option, including optional GPU pass diagnostics.
